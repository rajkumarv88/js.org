## Playht: Generate Realistic AI Voices in Seconds

Playht is a powerful AI-powered platform that allows users to clone voices and generate high-quality text-to-speech audio.  Upload an audio sample (as short as 30 seconds) and Playht will create a digital clone of that voice, enabling you to generate realistic speech from text in a variety of styles and tones.  This tool is useful for creating voiceovers for videos, podcasts, audiobooks, and more, and offers various voice styles and languages.  Its accessibility features make it particularly useful for individuals with speech impairments or those seeking to streamline content creation.  While offering a free tier, Playht's full functionality is subscription-based.
