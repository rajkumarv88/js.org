If you want to become a great developer, you need to master Git.

But Git can be confusing. With so many commands and options, it‚Äôs hard to know which ones actually matter.

In this article, I‚Äôll walk you through the **Top 20 Git Commands every developer should know**.

These are the exact commands I‚Äôve used over the past 11 years as a programmer. If you get comfortable with just these, you‚Äôll be ready for almost anything Git throws your way.

---

## 1. `git init`

Turns a regular folder into a Git repository by creating a hidden `.git` directory.

```bash
git init
```

Use this when starting a new project from scratch.

---

## 2. `git config`

Sets your user name and email identity for Git commits.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

---

## 3. `git clone`

Clones an existing repository from a remote source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

---

## 4. `git remote`

Manages your remote repositories.

```bash
git remote -v
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

---

## 5. `git status`

Displays the current state of the working directory and staging area.

```bash
git status
```

---

## 6. `git add`

Stages files for commit.

```bash
git add filename
git add .
```

---

## 7. `git commit`

Records changes to the repository.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git commit --amend  # To modify the last commit
```

---

## 8. `git push`

Uploads local changes to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## 9. `git pull`

Fetches and merges changes from a remote branch.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## 10. `git fetch`

Downloads changes from the remote repository but doesn't apply them.

```bash
git fetch origin
```

---

## 11. `git branch`

Lists, creates, or deletes branches.

```bash
git branch
git branch new-feature
```

---

## 12. `git checkout`

Switches branches or restores files.

```bash
git checkout new-feature
git checkout -b another-feature
git checkout -- file.txt
```

> Alternative: Use `git switch branch-name` for switching branches.

---

## 13. `git merge`

Merges one branch into the current branch.

```bash
git merge new-feature
```

---

## 14. `git rebase`

Reapplies commits on top of another base tip.

```bash
git rebase main
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be cautious with rebasing public/shared branches.

---

## 15. `git log`

Shows commit history.

```bash
git log
git log --oneline
git log --graph --oneline
```

---

## 16. `git diff`

Shows the differences between changes.

```bash
git diff
git diff main new-feature
```

---

## 17. `git stash`

Temporarily stores changes without committing.

```bash
git stash
git stash list
git stash apply
git stash pop
```

---

## 18. `git reset`

Moves the current branch tip and optionally modifies the index and working directory.

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

---

## 19. `git revert`

Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit.

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

---

## 20. `git cherry-pick`

Applies the changes introduced by a specific commit to the current branch.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

---
