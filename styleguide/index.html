            Every large and well-maintained codebase follows a style guide—a shared set of conventions that make the code easier to read, maintain, and extend over time. Even if the rules seem arbitrary at first, they help teams write code in a consistent and predictable way.

        </p>
        <p>This project, rkoots/styleguide, brings together style rules and guidelines we follow across our codebases. Whether you're working on frontend templates, backend logic, or shared libraries, consistent style helps new contributors ramp up quickly and prevents accidental tech debt.</p>

        <p class="note">These documents cover everything from naming conventions and file structure, to broader principles like “avoid globals” or “prefer composition over inheritance.” If you're working on or contributing to a project that originated from rkoots, you may be directed here to follow applicable coding standards.</p>

        <p>Where applicable, we also include links to trusted tools or community forks that extend these standards — especially when certain linters or formatters have matured into their own open-source ecosystems.</p>
