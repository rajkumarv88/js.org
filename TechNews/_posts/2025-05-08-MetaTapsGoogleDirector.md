## Meta Taps Former Google DeepMind Director to Lead Its AI Research Lab

Meta has appointed Robert Fergus to head its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab, according to a report by *Bloomberg*.

Fergus brings extensive experience to the role, having worked at Google DeepMind as a research director for approximately five years. Prior to his tenure at Google, he served as a research scientist at Meta. This marks a return to Meta for Fergus, as he re-engages with the company's AI efforts.

### The Challenges Faced by FAIR

Meta’s FAIR lab, established in 2013, has encountered some challenges in recent years. According to *Fortune*, despite leading the research behind major AI models like Llama 1 and Llama 2, the unit has experienced a significant number of departures. Many researchers have moved to other startups, companies, or Meta’s newer GenAI group, which recently launched the development of Llama 4.

In addition to this, Meta’s previous VP of AI Research, Joelle Pineau, announced in April that she would be leaving the company for new opportunities, further highlighting the challenges within the AI research unit.

### A New Era for Meta’s AI Research

With Robert Fergus now at the helm of FAIR, Meta hopes to revitalize the lab and push the boundaries of its AI research. His leadership will be crucial in helping Meta regain its standing in the competitive AI space.

This new leadership change at Meta signals a fresh chapter for the company's AI ambitions. We will have to wait and see how the direction of FAIR evolves under Fergus' guidance.
