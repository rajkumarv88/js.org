## Apple Said to be Developing New Chips for Smart Glasses, Macs, and More

Apple is reportedly working on the development of new, innovative chips designed to power smart glasses, more advanced Macs, and even AI servers. This exciting move signals Apple's ongoing commitment to enhancing its product lineup with cutting-edge technology.

### Focus on Smart Glasses

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, one of these chips is said to draw inspiration from the low-power processors used in the Apple Watch. This chip could play a key role in Apple's upcoming smart glasses, which are expected to rival Meta’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Meta has had significant success in the smart glasses market, having sold approximately 2 million pairs of their Ray-Ban Metas since 2023.

Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, is reportedly determined to surpass Meta's success in the smart glasses space, making it a major focus for the company. Sources indicate that Apple is targeting mass production of these chips in collaboration with TSMC by the end of next year, or potentially by 2027.

### Non-AR Glasses: A New Frontier

Unlike the AR glasses that some might expect, Apple is also exploring the development of non-augmented reality (AR) smart glasses. These glasses would utilize cameras to scan the user's environment, with AI assisting in real-time tasks without heavily draining the battery. One of the chips currently under development is specifically designed to control the cameras and other essential components in the glasses, ensuring optimal performance while keeping energy consumption low.

Apple's move into this market is likely to further shape the future of smart wearables, possibly offering a more practical and energy-efficient alternative to the current crop of smart glasses.
